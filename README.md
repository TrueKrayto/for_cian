# You need an api key from the website https://console.groq.com/login they are free
# THE API KEYS ONLY SHOW ONCE SO SAVE IT SOMEWHERE!
# repalce the text on line 6 of the code.py file with the api
# run -> pip install groq (in your terminal)
# once you have the file get the directory path with the command pwd save the full path including the file name
# the path should be something like "/home/usr/directory/code.py"
# run this command in your terminal "nano ~/.bashrc" (w/o "s)
# choose a variable_name for your file i.e. AI
# add this line to the bashrc file at the bottom export vairable_name="full path to the pyhton file"
# then call $variable_name from anywhere in your terminal (note this should work in your terminal in VS code as well)
